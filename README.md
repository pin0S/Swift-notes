# Swift-notes

## Day 1

### Variables & Constants

- `var` = vary meaning it can change.
- `let` is a constant - meaning this is a value can’t change

```swift
let manger = "Michael Scott"
var assistantManger = "Dwight Schrute"
```

#### Strings

- have to use double quotes (annoying)
- Multi-line string

```swift
"""
This is a
multi-line
string
"""
```

Some useful methods:

```swift
someString.uppercased()
someString.count
someString.hasPrefix("Mr")
someString.hasSuffix(".png")

```

### Numbers

- Integers or `Int` are how swift types whole numbers.

```swift
let age = 33
```

- You can write big boy numbers out like this `100_000_000`
- They use all the standard operators: `-`, `+`, `*`, `/`
- Also have shorthand operators `+=` etc.
- useful method `isMultiple(:of)`

```swift
print(50.isMultiple(of: 5))
```

- Decimals or floating-point numbers are type `Double`, short for the mouthful “double-precision floating-point number”,
- You can’t YOLO it and add integers to decimals

```swift
let yoloMath = 0.1 + 1 // won't work because of type safety
```

<aside>
🦺 Type safety in Swift means that once Swift has decided what data type a constant or variable holds, it must always hold that same data type. So the below won’t work, it will say `Cannot assign value of type 'Double' to type 'String'`

</aside>

```swift
var name = "Nicolas Cage"
name = 2.0
```

- Sometimes you’ll see **`CGFloat`** floating around 😏 that is just an old fashion way of storing floats
